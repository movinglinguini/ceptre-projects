# Planning Domains in Linear Logic

This project contains code for exploring what it takes to translate PDDL domains into Ceptre's fragment of Intuitionistic Linear Logic.

Each folder in this one is named after the edition of International Planning Competition (IPC) that its planning domains came from. Subfolders of each of these folders are named after the domain listed in the competition. For example, `ipc-1998/assembly` is referrencing the `assembly` domain from IPC 1998.
